So, while many of you have been thinking of other things, my book has come out â€“ and to critical acclaim. Or more precisely to a review in the Daily Telegraph that I am pleased to say gives it five stars. You can read it here: <a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11558359/The-News-from-Waterloo-the-Race-to-Tell-Britain-ofWellingtons-Victory-by-Brian-Cathcart.html'>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11558359/The-News-from-Waterloo-the-Race-to-Tell-Britain-ofWellingtons-Victory-by-Brian-Cathcart.html</a>.

A five-star review has also appeared on Amazon, and it's not by me but by a regular reviewer there who goes by the name of 'oldbiker'. Here: <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0571315259'>http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0571315259</a> I have developed a sudden affection for old bikers everywhere. 

That seems a pretty good start. (I give warning, though, that I will not necessarily report every review I get here.)  
Meanwhile I have had a piece published in the Independent on Sunday magazine that is not an extract but more a condensation of the parts of the book dealing with (and to the best of my ability dismissing) the antisemitic myth that Nathan Rothschild made a stock market killing thanks to exclusive news of Waterloo. You can read that here:

It stirred a bit of interest  on Twitter. You can read lots more about the Rothschild angle in the book, and on the website: <a href='thenewsfromwaterloo.com'>thenewsfromwaterloo.com</a>.

And if you can get to north London on Wednesday evening (13 May) a chance to hear me talk a little about the book at the Muswell Hill Bookshop on Fortis Green Road. See here: <a href='http://www.muswellhillbookshop.com/events.html'>http://www.muswellhillbookshop.com/events.html</a>
