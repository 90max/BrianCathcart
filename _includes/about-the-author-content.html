<p>The News From Waterloo is my eighth book, an enterprise that began when I was preparing a lecture. I wanted to illustrate to smartphone-era students at Kingston University, where I teach, what news communication was like before the age of electricity or even steam power, so I looked up how long it took for word of Waterloo to reach London in 1815. I could only find confusion, so I dug a bit more and then a bit more, and in that way the book was born.</p>
<p>I’m 58 years old and I have been professor of journalism at Kingston for nearly ten years.  I live in north London -- the commute is easier than you might think -- with my wife Ruth and I have two grown-up sons with whom I share, among other things, a devotion (and two season tickets) to Arsenal Football Club. I don’t count being a football supporter as leisure – a lot of the time it’s not even pleasure. In my leisure hours I buy second-hand books, read old-fashioned detective fiction (Chandler, Simenon), watch birds in the garden or walk – we plan to complete the Pennine Way this year.</p>
<h3>Journalism and history</h3>
<p>The News From Waterloo neatly brings together my two chief interests and preoccupations, journalism and history. I have been a journalist since I was 21 and a history enthusiast for longer than that. I am the son of two teachers – my father also wrote media history (see <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Most-Contrary-Region-Northern-Ireland/dp/0856403237'>http://www.amazon.co.uk/Most-Contrary-Region-Northern-Ireland/dp/0856403237</a>). I was born and educated in Ireland, taking a history degree at Trinity College Dublin before joining Reuters news agency in 1978. From Reuters I moved to the London Independent papers as they launched, eventually becoming deputy editor of the Sunday paper. By then I had written my first history book, <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Test-Greatness-Britains-Struggle-Atom/dp/0719552257'>Test of Greatness</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving the Independent on Sunday in 1997 I wrote <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Were-You-Still-Up-Portillo/dp/0140272372'>Were You Still Up for Portillo?</a> and that was followed by <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Case-Stephen-Lawrence-Brian-Cathcart/dp/0140279059'>The Case of Stephen Lawrence</a>. <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jill-Dando-Her-Life-Death/dp/0140294686/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427135680&sr=1-1&keywords=cathcart+dando'>Jill Dando: Her Life and Death</a> , <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rain-Brian-Cathcart/dp/1862075344/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427135788&sr=1-1&keywords=cathcart+rain'>Rain</a> and then <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fly-Cathedral-Small-Cambridge-Scientists/dp/0140279067/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427135853&sr=1-2&keywords=cathcart+fly+cathedral'>The Fly in the Cathedral</a></p>
<p>I never stopped being a journalist (in these freelance years I wrote a good deal about the Deepcut scandal) and by 2007 I had a weekly media column in the New Statesman. That drew me towards the unfolding phone-hacking scandal and the press regulation debate. In 2011 I was one of the founders of Hacked Off and became its first executive director in 2012, when I published <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Everybodys-Hacked-Off-Penguin-Specials-ebook/dp/B0098P1AA2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427136044&sr=1-1&keywords=cathcart+hacked+off'>Everybody’s Hacked Off</a>  The campaign for a free press that is also accountable – I see it as a campaign for better journalism – continues, and though I stepped down as executive director last year I remain deeply committed and involved.</p>
<h3>Writing and research</h3>
<p>Writing The News From Waterloo has been a great pleasure. It’s about news, which I love, and much of the essential information comes from the newspapers of 1815, which are not only engrossing but in many cases can also now be read online. I recall making one significant  discovery while sitting on the living room sofa one evening word-searching newspapers while half-watching the television. But the research has also got me out and about to a variety of libraries and archives, and I have followed Henry Percy’s route from Waterloo to London (though not the bit across the North Sea).</p>
<p>It may be corny to say it, but I hope people enjoy reading the book as much as I enjoyed writing it. It turned out to be a tale of adventure and intrigue – a Regency caper, you might say – but I have also been surprised by how much my research taught me about news, journalism and newspapers, and the people involved in them. A lot of that is relevant today. If The News From Waterloo passes some of those insights on to readers too I will be very pleased.</p>
