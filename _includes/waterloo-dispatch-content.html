<p>Waterloo June 19th 1815</p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>Bonaparte, having collected the first, second, third, fourth and sixth corps of 

the French army and the Imperial Guards, and nearly all the cavalry, <span>on the 

Sambre and between that river and the Meuse</span>, between the tenth and 

fourteenth of the month, advanced on the 15th, and attacked the Prussian 

posts <span>at Thuin and Lobbes</span> on the Sambre at daylight in the morning.</p>

<p>I did not hear of these events till in the evening of the fifteenth and I 

immediately ordered the troops to prepare to march – and afterwards to 

march to their left, as soon as I had intelligence from other quarters to prove 

that the enemy's movement upon Charleroi was the real attack.</p>

<p>The enemy drove the Prussian posts from the Sambre on that day, <span>and 

General Ziethen, who commanded the corps which had been at Charleroi, 

retired upon Fleurus</span>, and Marshal <span>Prince</span> Blücher concentrated the Prussian 

army upon Sombref <span>holding the villages in front of his position of St Amand 

and Ligny</span>.</p>

<p>The enemy continued his march along the road from Charleroi towards 

Brussels and on the same evening, the fifteenth, attacked a brigade of the 

army of the Netherlands under the Prince de Weimar <span>posted at Frasne</span>, and 

forced it back to the farmhouse on the same road called Les Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange immediately reinforced this brigade with another of the 

same division <span>under General Perponcher</span>, and in the morning, early, regained 

part of the ground which had been lost, so as to have the command of the 

communication <span>leading from Nivelles and Brussels</span> with Marshal Blücher's 

position.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had directed the whole army to march upon Les Quatre 

Bras, and the fifth division, under Lieutenant-General <span>Sir Thomas</span> Picton, 

arrived at about half past two in the day, followed by the corps of troops under 

the Duke of Brunswick and afterwards by the contingent of Nassau.</p>

<p><span class='anchor'>PRELIMINARY ENGAGEMENTS</span></p>

<p>At this time the enemy commenced an attack upon Prince Blücher with his 

whole force – excepting the first and second corps and a corps of cavalry 

under General Kellermann, with which he attacked our post at Les Quatre 

Bras.</p>

<p>The Prussian army maintained their position with their usual gallantry and

perseverance against a great disparity of numbers <span>as the fourth corps of their 

army under General Bülow had not joined</span>, and I was not able to assist them 

as I wished, as I was attacked myself, and the troops – the cavalry in 

particular, <span>which had a long distance to march</span> – had not arrived.</p>

<p>We maintained our position also, and completely defeated and repulsed all

the enemy's attempts to get possession of it. The enemy repeatedly attacked 

us with a large body of infantry and cavalry supported by a numerous and 

powerful artillery. He made several charges with the cavalry upon our infantry 

but all were repulsed in the steadiest manner.</p>

<p>In this affair His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange, the Duke of 

Brunswick, and Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton, and Major-Generals 

Sir James Kempt and Sir Denis Pack <span>who were engaged from the 

commencement of the enemy's attack</span> highly distinguished themselves, as 

well as Lieutenant-General Charles Baron Alten, Major-General Sir C. 

Halkett, Lieutenant-General Cooke, and Major-Generals Maitland and Byng, 

– <span>as they successively arrived</span>.</p>

<p>The troops of the fifth division and those of the Brunswick corps were long 

and severely engaged, and conducted themselves with the utmost gallantry. I 

must particularly mention the twenty-eighth, forty-second, seventy-ninth and 

ninety-second regiments, and the battalion of Hanoverians.</p>

<p>Our loss was great, as <span>your Lordship will perceive by the enclosed return</span>, and 

I have particularly to regret His Serene Highness the Duke of Brunswick, who 

fell fighting gallantly at the head of his troops.</p>

<p>Although Marshal Blücher had maintained his position at Sombref, he still

found himself much weakened by the severity of the contest in which he had 

been engaged, and <span>as the fourth corps had not arrived</span> he determined to fall 

back and to concentrate his army upon Wavre; and he marched all the night, 

after the action was over.</p>

<p><span class='anchor'>WELLINGTON FALLS BACK TO WATERLOO</span></p>

<p>This movement of the Marshal’s rendered necessary a corresponding one 

upon my part; and I retired from the farm of Quatre Bras upon Genappe and 

thence upon Waterloo the next morning – the seventeenth – at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>The enemy made no effort to pursue Marshal Blücher. On the contrary, a

patrol which I sent to Sombref in the morning found all quiet and the enemy's 

vedettes fell back as the patrol advanced. Neither did he attempt to molest 

our march to the rear although made in the middle of the day – excepting by 

following, with a large body of cavalry brought from his right, the cavalry 

under the Earl of Uxbridge.</p>

<p>This gave Lord Uxbridge an opportunity of charging them with the First Life 

Guards upon their <span>débouché</span> from the village of Genappe – upon which 

occasion his Lordship has declared himself to be well satisfied with that 

regiment.</p>

<p>The position which I took up in front of Waterloo crossed the high roads from

Charleroi and Nivelles and had its right thrown back to a ravine near Merke 

Braine, <span>which was occupied</span>, and its left extended to a height above the 

hamlet Ter la Haye, <span>which was likewise occupied</span>.</p>

<p>In front of the right centre, and near the Nivelles road, we occupied the house 

and garden of Hougoumont, <span>which covered the return of that flank</span>; and in 

front of the <span>left centre</span> we occupied the farm of La Haye Sainte. By our left we 

communicated with Marshal Prince Blücher at Wavre <span>through Ohain</span>; and the 

Marshal had promised me that in case we should be attacked he would 

support me with one or more corps as might be necessary.</p>

<p><span class='anchor'>THE BATTLE</span></p>

<p>The enemy collected his army <span>with the exception of the Third Corps, which

had been sent to observe Marshal Blücher</span> on a range of heights in our front 

in the course of the night of the seventeenth and yesterday morning, and, at 

about ten o’clock, he commenced a furious attack upon our post at 

Hougoumont.</p>

<p>I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of 

Guards which was in position in its rear <span>and it was for some time under the 

command of Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell and afterwards of Colonel Home 

and</span> I am happy to add that it was maintained throughout the day with the 

utmost gallantry by these brave troops – notwithstanding the repeated efforts 

of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.</p>

<p>This attack upon the right of our centre was accompanied by a very heavy 

cannonade upon our whole line <span>which</span> was destined to support the repeated 

attacks of cavalry and infantry, <span>occasionally mixed, but sometimes separate, </span>

which were made upon it. In one of these the enemy carried the farmhouses 

of La Haye Sainte, as the detachment of the light battalion <span>of the Legion</span> 

which occupied it had expended all its ammunition, <span>and the enemy occupied 

the only communication there was with them</span>.</p>

<p>The enemy repeatedly charged our infantry with his cavalry, but these attacks 

were uniformly unsuccessful, and they afforded opportunities to <span>our cavalry</span> to 

charge – in one of which Lord Edward Somerset's brigade, consisting of the 

Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards and First Dragoon Guards, highly 

distinguished themselves, as did that of Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, 

having taken many prisoners and an Eagle.</p>

<p>These attacks were repeated till about seven in the evening, when the enemy

made a desperate effort with cavalry and infantry, supported by the fire of 

artillery, to force our left centre near the farm of La Haye Sainte, which after a 

severe contest was defeated.</p>

<p>And, having observed that the troops retired from this attack in great 

confusion <span>and that the march of General Bülow's corps by Frischermont upon 

Plancenoit and La Belle Alliance had begun to take effect, and as I could 

perceive the fire of his cannon</span> and as Marshal Prince Blücher had joined in 

person with a corps of his army to the left of our line <span>by Ohain</span>, I determined to 

attack the enemy and immediately advanced the whole line of infantry 

supported by the cavalry and artillery.</p>

<p>The attack succeeded in every point. The enemy was forced from his 

positions on the heights and fled in the utmost confusion, leaving behind him, 

as far as I could judge, one hundred and fifty pieces of cannon with their 

ammunition, <span>which fell into our hands</span>.</p>

<p>I continued the pursuit till long after dark, and then discontinued it only on 

account of the fatigue of our troops who had been engaged during twelve 

hours, and because I found myself on the same road with Marshal Blücher, 

who assured me of his intention to follow the enemy throughout the night.</p>

<p>He has sent me word this morning that he had taken sixty pieces of cannon

belonging to the Imperial Guard and several carriages, baggage etcetera 

belonging to Bonaparte, in Genappe.</p>

<p>I propose to move this morning upon Nivelles and not to discontinue my 

operations.</p>

<p><span class='anchor'>IMMENSE LOSSES</span></p>

<p>Your Lordship will observe that such a desperate action could not be fought 

and such advantages could not be gained without great loss, and I am sorry 

to add that ours has been immense.</p>

<p>In Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton His Majesty has sustained the loss 

of an officer who has frequently distinguished himself in his service, and he 

fell gloriously leading his division to a charge with bayonets by which one of 

the most serious attacks made by the enemy on our position was defeated.</p>

<p>The Earl of Uxbridge, after having successfully got through this arduous day, 

received a wound by almost the last shot fired which will, I am afraid, deprive 

His Majesty for some time of his services.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange distinguished himself by his 

gallantry and conduct till he received a wound from a musket ball through the 

shoulder which obliged him to quit the field.</p>

<p>It gives me the greatest satisfaction to assure your Lordship that the army 

never upon any occasion conducted itself better. The division of Guards 

under Lieutenant-General Cooke, who is severely wounded, Major-General 

Maitland and Major-General Byng set an example which was followed by all, 

and there is no officer nor description of troops that did not behave well.</p>

<p>I must, however, particularly mention for His Royal Highness's approbation 

Lieutenant-General Sir H. Clinton, Major-General Adam, Lieutenant-General 

Charles Baron Alten, severely wounded, Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, 

severely wounded, Colonel Ompteda, Colonel Mitchell, commanding a 

brigade of the Fourth division, Major-Generals Sir James Kempt and Sir 

Denis Pack, Major-General Lambert, Major-General Lord E. Somerset, Major-

General Sir W. Ponsonby, Major-General Sir C. Grant and Major-General Sir 

H. Vivian, Major-General Sir O. Vandeleur, and Major-General Count 

Dörnberg.</p>

<p>I am also particularly indebted to General Lord Hill for his assistance and 

conduct upon this, as upon all former occasions.</p>

<p>The engineer and artillery departments were conducted much to my 

satisfaction by Colonel Sir G. Wood and Colonel Smyth; and I had every 

reason to be satisfied with the conduct of the Adjutant General Major-General 

Barnes, who was wounded; and of the Quartermaster General, Colonel De 

Lancey, who was killed by a cannon shot in the middle of the action. This 

officer is a serious loss to His Majesty's service – and to me at this moment.</p>

<p>I was likewise much indebted to the assistance of Lieutenant-Colonel Lord 

FitzRoy Somerset, who was severely wounded, and of the officers composing 

my personal staff who have suffered severely in this action. Lieutenant-

Colonel the Honourable Sir Alexander Gordon, who has died of his wounds, 

was a most promising officer and is a serious loss to His Majesty's service.</p>

<p><span class='anchor'>PRAISE FOR THE ALLIES</span></p>

<p>General Kruse of the Nassau service likewise conducted himself much to my

satisfaction as did General Tripp, commanding the heavy brigade of cavalry, 

and General Vanhope, commanding a brigade of infantry in the service of the 

King of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>General Pozzo di Borgo, General Baron Vincent, General Müffling, and 

General Alava were in the field during the action and rendered me every 

assistance in their power. Baron Vincent is wounded but I hope not severely; 

and General Pozzo di Borgo received a contusion.</p>

<p>I should not do justice to my own feelings or to Marshal Blücher and the 

Prussian army if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to 

the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of 

General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one, and, even if 

I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the 

final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have 

failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they 

should unfortunately have succeeded.</p>

<p>I send with this dispatch two Eagles taken by the troops in this action, which 

Major Percy will have the honour of laying at the feet of His Royal Highness.</p>

<p>I beg leave to recommend him to your Lordship's protection.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be your Lordship’s most obedient humble servant,

Wellington</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have received a report that Major-General Sir

William Ponsonby is killed, and in announcing this intelligence to your 

Lordship, I have to add the expression of my grief for the fate of an officer 

who had already rendered very brilliant and important services and was an 

ornament to his profession.</p>
