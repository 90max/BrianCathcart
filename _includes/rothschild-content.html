	<h3>Read the myth</h3>

	The Rothschild-Waterloo myth first gained wide currency thanks to this French 

	pamphlet of 1846 appears to have set the ball rolling:

	Satan (Georges Dairnvaell) (1846) Histoire Edifiante et Curieuse de Rothschild 

	1er, Roi des Juifs, Paris. PP11-12.

	In the century and a half since then it has assumed many forms and has been 

	repeated by a great variety of writers in very different kinds of publication. 

	Here is a selection. (If you know of others, and I know there are many more, 

	please let me know through the Contact page of this website.)

	Note: It’s worth stressing that while the myth and its propagation owe a good 

	deal to anti-Semitism, many of these writers have had no such motivation.

		<li style='background-color: black; padding: 15px;'><p>The News From Waterloo debunks the widely known myth that the first man in London to know of 

		Wellington’s victory at Waterloo was Nathan Rothschild, founder of the bank N.M. Rothschild and 

		Sons, and that Rothschild used this exclusive knowledge to make a killing on the London Stock 

		Exchange.</p> 

		<p>Many details are in the book, but there is much more – not least because this myth has adopted 

		many forms over the years and there simply wasn’t room to tackle all of them without giving the 

		whole, half-baked story excessive prominence.</p> 

		<p>The pages explore further angles to the myth and look at the evidence or absence of evidence 

		behind them.</p></li>
