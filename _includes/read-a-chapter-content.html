<h2 id='title'>Chapter 2</h2>

<p id='introduction'>It is after 9pm on Sunday, 18 June 1815. After a day of fighting the Duke of Wellington has met Blücher, the commander of the allied Prussian army, and they have acknowledged to each other the decisive defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. It is an event that will astound all Europe…</p>
<br>

<div id='chapter2'>

<p>As twilight turned to darkness in Belgium, the Duke of Wellington had other things on his mindbesides telling the world about his victory. Parting from Blücher, he turned his famous horse Copenhagen towards Waterloo village and the inn where he had slept the previous night. Generals are rarely alone on campaign, and accompanying the duke now was a trusted entourage of senior officers, aides-de-camp and diplomats representing the allied powers. By some accounts they dismounted and walked part of the way. It was at least four miles to the inn, and the road took them back through the scenes of some of the day’s most murderous action. An officer who passed that way soon afterwards described the spectacle:</p>

<span>The dead were innumerable, French and English intermixed. Those who had fallen in the road had been trampled on by horses and wheels of artillery into a mass of blood, flesh and clothes, hardly to be distinguished one from the other In the hollow between the two armies on each side of the road there lay piles of dead Frenchmen and horses, among whom were many of the Imperial Guard.</span>

<p>It was a charnel house, a hellish scene illuminated by a thousand camp fires. The corpses, many already stripped naked, were heaped highest in those places where the fighting had been fiercest. Here and there Wellington returned the greetings of his soldiers and acknowledged the occasional cheer, but the mood was more funereal than triumphant. And once they were past the worst of the battlefield they found themselves among the pathetic columns of the wounded, some walking and some borne in carts, all heading rearwards in the hope of relief.</p>

<p>It was past 11 p.m. when they reached the inn, and there Wellington found a young officer from his staff fighting for his life. Sir Alexander Gordon was an aide-de-camp who had campaigned with the duke for six years and of whom he was especially fond. In the final phase of the battle Gordon was struck in the thigh by a musket ball – by one account, at a moment when he was begging his commander to take cover. The shattered leg was amputated, but Gordon had lost too much blood and by the time Wellington reached his bedside he was weak and, despite doses of laudanum and wine, in pain and distress. He could barely speak, but the duke was able to tell him that the battle had ended in victory.</p>
<p>Waterloo had taken a toll on both sides that shocked even the most experienced campaigners. Almost a quarter of the allied army, it would later be calculated, had been killed or wounded or had gone missing. There is barely a memoir or a letter by any survivor that does not reflect horror, and it has been said that, measured in casualties per square mile, the carnage bears comparison with the first day of the Somme in 1916. For Wellington this came very close. Although miraculously he himself had escaped injury, of his personal staff of half a dozen men – a little group known as his ‘family’ – one was dead, another was dying and a third had been rushed to Brussels after losing an arm. Some of his most senior officers had been killed or gravely wounded, and the list was growing alarmingly. His most seasoned infantry general was dead. His cavalry commander had lost a leg. His Guards commander had lost an arm. His quartermaster was dying.2 And, as he had been reminded so vividly on his homeward trudge, the toll of other ranks had been terrible. So it was in depleted and subdued company that the duke sat down to supper.</p>

<p>The inn was small, and since the dining room was given over to the wounded the table was set in the duke’s bedroom upstairs, where the party numbered eight or ten, among them some of the diplomats. Military dinners at this time often entailed prodigious feats of alcohol consumption, but on this occasion just one toast was proposed and that was not to victory but to the memory of the Peninsular War, which had first brought most of them together. Years later one of those present recalled: ‘The Duke said very little, ate hastily and heartily, but every time the door opened he gave a searching look, evidently in the hope of some of his valuable staff approaching.’3 As they talked, a question arose. Should something be done that night to get the news to the king of France? Louis XVIII had been staying in the city of Ghent, on the far side of Brussels, and was poised, anxiously, to retreat northward in the event of an allied defeat. Wellington declared himself too tired to write, and it was agreed instead that the job would be done by one of the diplomats at the table. The duke instructed him to inform the king that</p>

<span>the most complete victory he had ever gained had been gained that day and that the French

army was in complete rout; that he himself [Wellington] had followed them several miles and 

had seen sixty pieces of cannon taken, and that they were now closely pursued by the 

Prussians and could not possibly halt again on this side of the frontier.</span>

<p>Soon after this the guests departed, and Wellington retired to bed.</p>

<p>By now it must have been nearly 1 a.m. What had been done to spread the word? Wellington, 

who as allied commander had a unique authority to pronounce on the outcome, had made no 

effort even to get the news to Brussels, let alone transmit it to his government in London or, for 

that matter, to his own family there. The only communication he had authorised was that letter to 

the king of France, and even that may not have been his idea. Nor, for that matter, was he 

assuming that his subordinates were doing the job for him: there is no record of any other senior 

officer taking responsibility for the task that night, and no one afterwards expressed the view that 

this had been an oversight. This may seem strange, but British military convention of the time held 

that significant events should be reported to London in formal dispatches written by the 

commanding officer at the scene. That was both his duty and his prerogative. And such 

dispatches were rarely brief since they were not only a medium of news but an official record and 

even a first draft of history (so that to be ‘mentioned in dispatches’ was a lasting badge of 

honour). Trouble and time must be spent getting this right. Wellington had sent many dispatches 

from his campaigns in India, Portugal, Spain and southern France, and it had never been his habit 

to write them immediately after battle. Of course, in those earlier cases the lines of communication 

were longer, and when it took weeks or even months for a dispatch to reach London a delay of a 

few hours in the writing, or even of a couple of days, counted for little. Waterloo was much closer 

to London than, say, Salamanca or Badajoz, but Wellington would not be hurried. He saw the 

priorities clearly: what mattered was whether Napoleon was beaten, not when ministers learned 

about it. It is likely, however, that on the night of Waterloo he barely considered such matters, for 

whatever the protocol was, and whatever his personal habits, he simply did not feel equal to the 

task. This was not a man brimming with pride in a great achievement and eager to share it with 

others. Instead, he was weary to the bone and, as he would write the next day, ‘quite broken 

down’ by the losses sustained by his army.5 When the idea of writing to the king of France came 

up that night, we are told, ‘the Duke said no, that he had won the battle for him but that he was so 

exhausted that he could not write a letter that night but must go to bed’.</p>

<!--first divider-->

<p>He did not sleep long. At 3.30 a.m., just as dawn was breaking, Gordon died of his wounds, and

the surgeon, John Hume, was hesitating over whether to tell Wellington when his mind was made 

up for him by a senior officer seeking orders from the duke for troop movements. Hume later 

painted a vivid picture of the scene:</p>

<span>On this I decided to see if he was awake, and going upstairs to his room I tapped gently at the 

door, when he told me to come in. He had, as usual, taken off all of his clothes, but had not 

washed himself; and as I entered the room he sat up in his bed, his face covered with the dust 

and sweat of the previous day, and extended his hand to me, which I took and held in mine 

whilst I told him of Gordon’s death and related such of the casualties as had come to my 

knowledge. He was much affected. I felt tears dropping fast upon my hands, and looking 

towards him, saw them chasing one another in furrows over his dusty cheeks. He brushed 

them suddenly away with his left hand and said to me, in a voice tremulous with emotion, 

‘Well! Thank God I don’t know what it is to lose a battle, but certainly nothing can be more 

painful than to gain one with the loss of so many of one’s friends.’</span>

<p>Now at last Wellington turned his thoughts to his dispatch. He dressed and ate some toast, and 

by the time he took up his pen the sun was coming up to light the work. To this day in the inn at 

Waterloo (now a museum) are preserved a chair and folding table he is said to have used, and an 

artist later painted the scene.8 On the face of it his job was straightforward: he had to give an 

account of the fighting, identify officers and regiments who had distinguished themselves, provide a 

first estimate of casualties and indicate what his next moves might be. But he must have known 

that this was a dispatch unlike any other he had written. So sensational was the victory, so decisive 

and significant the battle, that every household in Britain would soon know about it and speak of it. 

And for every reader in the English language the dispatch would be the essential document and 

might remain so for years. In short, Wellington was composing a historic text.</p>

<span>Addressing himself to the Secretary for War, Lord Bathurst, he began:</span>
<span>Bonaparte, having collected the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th corps of the French army and the 

Imperial Guards and nearly all the cavalry on the Sambre and between that river and the 

Meuse between the 10th and 14th of the month, advanced on the 15th, and attacked the 

Prussian posts at Thuin and Lobbes on the Sambre at daylight in the morning. 

I did not hear of these events till in the evening of the 15th and I immediately ordered the 

troops to prepare to march; and afterwards to march to their left as soon as I had intelligence 

from other quarters to prove that the enemy’s movement upon Charleroi was the real attack.</span>

<p>This was, it is clear, no news bulletin; it did not open with the most important fact, that the French 

had been comprehensively defeated. Instead, in conventional dispatch style, it was a narrative. 

Though Wellington had fought two battles since the 15th and the Prussians a third, this was his first 

official report to London since the fighting began, and he started carefully and clearly at the 

beginning. The Prussian outposts, he explained, had fallen back before this first French advance, 

and the following day saw two battles. To the east, at Ligny, the Prussians were engaged, while in 

the west the French were halted by his army at Quatre Bras. In keeping with dispatch style, 

Wellington named those who did well in this first encounter: ‘His Royal Highness the Prince of 

Orange, the Duke of Brunswick, and Lieut. General Sir Thomas Picton, and Major Generals Sir 

James Kempt and Sir Denis Pack, who were engaged from the commencement of the enemy’s 

attack, highly distinguished themselves.’ And he did not reserve his praise for senior officers alone: 

‘The troops of the 5th division, and those of the Brunswick corps, were long and severely engaged, 

and conducted themselves with the utmost gallantry.’ We don’t know how much of this he wrote 

before he was forced to break off, but day had dawned and Brussels beckoned: there were jobs to 

be done and orders to be given. His polyglot army must be rallied, provisioned and set on the road 

to France in support of the Prussians. Moreover, with so many senior colleagues dead and 

wounded he had to make decisions that others would normally have made, and he had to consider 

how to fill the vacancies. So the draft dispatch was tucked away, the field trappings were packed 

up and Copenhagen was saddled again. Soon the duke and what remained of his staff were 

making their way along the chaotically cluttered road through the forest of Soignes to the Belgian 

capital.</p>

<p>By his own account the first words that greeted him on his arrival were: ‘What news?’9 It was early, 

and the city, or at least its large community of assorted expatriates, was still emerging from a 

period of terrifying uncertainty. Since their experience of the news from Waterloo will help shape 

London’s experience it is worth reviewing what had happened to them.</p>

<p>That spring and early summer, as the allies mustered their northern armies in Belgium, Brussels

had enjoyed a giddy spell as the social capital of Europe. In particular, it had become an unlikely 

second home for London’s high society, with officers and their wives and mistresses, aristocratic 

camp followers, politicians and well-heeled tourists of all kinds taking up residence. They and their 

many servants laid on balls, promenades, dinners, theatre, racing, hunting, cricket and everything 

else that was required to keep the British upper classes happy. Also enjoying the fun, if not the 

cricket, were exiled French royalists, representatives of the Prussian and other German forces, 

diplomats of all nations and – in some numbers – Dutch officials. These last were in town because 

the great powers, having liberated Belgium from Napoleonic rule in 1814, had decided in their 

wisdom to place it under Dutch rule instead, as part of a new Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>For this colourful community the climactic moment of the season would be the famous ball given 

by the Duchess of Richmond at her residence on the Rue de la Blanchisserie on the evening of 15 

June. More than two hundred were invited, and dancing was accommodated in an adjacent coach 

shed, lavishly fitted up for the night. The duke was seen to flirt outrageously with the woman who 

was the apple of his eye at that time, the married and very pregnant Lady Frances Wedderburn 

Webster. Precisely when he learned that the French had attacked that morning, or at least at what 

time he was satisfied this was not merely ‘an affair of outposts’, is a matter of controversy, but 

there is no doubt that he was distracted from the pleasures of the ball and eventually forced to 

abandon them by the need to organise the military response. From that moment Brussels ceased 

to be a place of enjoyment for expatriates and became frightening instead.</p>

<p>Most of the civilians had expected to observe from a comfortable distance as the allied armies 

rolled into France and humbled Bonaparte on his own soil, so the discovery that the fighting was 

moving rapidly in the opposite direction, and that they risked being taken prisoner, or worse, came 

as a great shock. Brussels was an open city, its ancient walls only surviving in parts, and it could 

not be defended against a French army. Nor did it help that many native bruxellois were thought to 

have no stomach for a fight: some saw little to choose between rule by the French and rule by the 

Dutch. So it was that, once the expatriates had seen the allied army march out in haste to confront 

the advancing enemy, panic took hold. A scramble for horses, carriages and places on passenger 

barges turned into an unseemly frenzy, with most people desperate to reach Antwerp, a walled city 

to the north that could be defended and from which, if necessary, they might escape to England by 

sea. On Saturday morning, after the first muddled news arrived from Ligny and Quatre Bras, 

followed swiftly by the first casualties, the panic was renewed and a further wave fled by whatever 

means they could find along the roads and canals. Even so, some expatriate civilians remained. 

The writer Fanny Burney had left it too late. As an Englishwoman married to a senior French 

royalist army officer she was doubly an enemy of Bonaparte, but when on Sunday morning she 

tried to find a place on a barge to Antwerp – no carriages were available by then – she discovered 

that all vessels had been requisitioned to move military stores and the wounded. Among others 

stranded was Thomas Creevey, an MP of the Whig opposition who had settled in Brussels the 

previous autumn in the expectation that it would be a quiet, cheap and comfortable place in which 

to nurse his invalid wife. By now Mrs Creevey was too ill to be moved, so he and his plucky 

stepdaughters, Ann and Elizabeth Ord, stayed on to share her fate. Elizabeth would later write: ‘I 

think Sunday was the most miserable day I ever spent in my life and one I could never forget if I 

was to live 1,000 years.’</p>

<p>They were all desperate for news from the battlefront. ‘All of which we seemed capable was to 

inquire or to relate, to speak or to hear,’ wrote Burney.</p>

<span>All the people of Brussels lived in the streets. Doors seemed of no use, for they were never 

shut. The individuals, when they re-entered their houses, only resided at the windows, so that 

the whole population of the city seemed constantly in public view.</span>

<p>Given that even Wellington himself could not have been sure of the outcome of the battle until 

after 8 p.m. at the earliest, and given also the nature of the fighting, it is hardly surprising that in the 

course of Sunday no clear or accurate picture reached the city a dozen miles away. Instead 

Burney, Creevey and the rest endured something much more distressing than ignorance, for 

events in the afternoon repeatedly conspired to suggest that the very worst was happening. The 

darkest moment was the dramatic passage through the town of an allied cavalry regiment in full 

flight and giving every impression that French dragoons were at their heels. These were the 

Cumberland Hussars, a regiment of aristocratic German volunteers who were held in reserve at 

Waterloo in the early part of the fighting and failed to follow the example of others by dismounting 

to take cover from the cannon fire. After watching their mounted comrades fall like ninepins for an 

hour or so they lost their nerve, and when they were eventually ordered into action they turned and 

fled. Reaching Brussels in great disorder, they clattered spectacularly up the Rue de Namur and 

crossed the Place Royale without a pause before continuing northward in the direction of Antwerp. 

This was probably the first of the several occasions on which word flashed around Brussels that 

‘The French are in the town!’ It happened again a little later, Burney records. A ‘violent, loud, 

affrighting’ howl went up, she wrote, ‘issuing from many voices’, but it turned out that this was a 

troop of captured French cavalrymen being paraded through the streets. By contrast, a fleeting 

moment of hope came when someone burst into Burney’s room shouting: ‘Bonaparte est pris! Le 

voilà! Le voilà! ’ She looked out of the window in excitement to see that, indeed, a senior French 

officer was being led into town on horseback, his hands tied, but her heart sank when she made 

out his face. This was not the emperor.</p>

<p>As afternoon turned to evening, it was British witnesses who were spreading alarm. Around 4 

p.m. Creevey met a fellow MP, Thomas Legh, who informed him that ‘everything looked as bad as 

possible’, and he soon found Legh’s view endorsed by a Guards officer just in from the battlefield: 

‘Why sir, I don’t like the appearance of things at all. The French are getting on in such a manner 

that I don’t see what’s to stop them.’12 Burney, too, found retreat and defeat on every lip. ‘The 

dearth of any positive news from the field of battle’, she wrote, was ‘nearly distracting in its torturing 

suspense to the wrung nerves’. Looking back on these hours, she lamented the inadequacy of 

official communication: ‘At certain houses, as well as at public offices, news, I doubt not, arrived; 

but no means were taken to promulgate it; no gazettes, as in London, no bulletins, as in Paris, 

were cried about the streets; we were all left at once with our conjectures and our destinies.’ She 

was right: at ‘certain offices’ there was indeed news, for the Dutch government had begun issuing 

bulletins in the name of its most senior official in the city, Baron Godert van der Capellen. His early 

reports presented a rosy interpretation of the events at Quatre Bras and Ligny, and his fourth 

bulletin, issued on Sunday at 8 a.m., gave the impression that the armies of Wellington and 

Blücher were preparing to attack the French. Dutch officials in Brussels were keen to sustain 

morale in the city by showing optimism, but they were poorly informed themselves and manifestly 

bad at spreading the word.</p>

<p>Around the town, the unofficial news seemed only to grow worse. At 10.30 p.m. Creevey, his 

wife and his stepdaughters received a visit from Major Andrew Hamilton, a family friend, who had 

just come from the battlefield accompanying a wounded general. Weary and depressed, he told his 

friends that, although the allies had fought heroically, it was his opinion when he left the field that 

the battle was lost, and he urged Creevey to take his family and escape in the hours that remained 

before the French arrived. Friends of Fanny Burney, meanwhile, were giving her a similarly bleak 

message: Bonaparte, having at first been driven back by Wellington, had executed a turning 

manoeuvre. Now the duke himself was in danger of capture, and Brussels would fall in the 

morning.</p>

<p>Creevey and his household went to bed fully dressed, fearing the worst. Burney, however, 

records that last thing at night ‘an officer burst into the room with assurances that the enemy was 

flying in all directions’. This was more accurate, but the difficulty by now, after so many different 

accounts, was that there was no more reason to believe him than anyone else. In fact, an official 

announcement was made in Brussels at 3 a.m. – a formal, printed bulletin from Baron van der 

Capellen declaring on behalf of the Dutch government that the allies had been victorious – but it 

does not appear to have been effectively disseminated, even after daybreak. Creevey, rising at 6 

a.m., heard nothing of it. Instead he made his way to the home of a friendly Belgian aristocrat in 

search of news and there received a surprise: ‘The first person I saw was Madame de Jaurenais, 

walking about in déshabillé amidst a great bivouac of horses. She told me immediately that the 

French were defeated and had fled in great confusion.’ A doubting Creevey tracked this 

information to its source, a senior British officer, who confirmed that he had received the welcome 

news by messenger from the battlefield in the early hours. With that Creevey was convinced, but 

his stepdaughter Elizabeth, after all the confusion of Sunday, took longer to satisfy. ‘Though the 

good news was more confirmed every minute,’ she wrote, ‘we hardly knew how to believe it.’ As for 

Fanny Burney, she did not conquer her doubts for another whole day: ‘It was not till Tuesday the 

20th I had certain and satisfactory assurances how complete was the victory.’</p>

<p>So it was into a dazed and almost disbelieving city, not yet ready for general jubilation, that 

Wellington rode around 8 a.m. It was Creevey who called out to him, ‘What news?’ and the duke 

replied: ‘Why, I think we’ve done for ’em this time.’ Briskly he made his way to his Brussels 

residence overlooking the park and after conducting some urgent business sought the quiet of an 

upstairs room. There he would complete the official dispatch, but not before dashing off this note:</p>

<span>My dear Lady Frances,

Lord Mountnorris may remain in Brussels in perfect security. I yesterday, after a most severe 

and bloody contest, gained a complete victory, and pursued the French till after dark. They are 

in complete confusion and I have, I believe, 150 pieces of cannon; and Blücher, who continued 

the pursuit all night, my soldiers being tired to death, sent me word this morning that he had 

got 60 more. 

My loss is immense. Lord Uxbridge, Lord FitzRoy Somerset, General Cooke, General 

Barnes and Colonel Berkeley are wounded; Colonel de Lancey, Canning, Gordon, General 

Picton killed. The finger of Providence was upon me, and I escaped unhurt.

Believe me, etc., 

Wellington</span>

<p>This was timed at 8.30 a.m. That he should have given priority to putting at rest the mind of Lady 

Frances Wedderburn Webster tells us a good deal about the duke’s feelings for her, but no less 

striking is the style of the note: in a hundred words he summed up the story of a bloody contest 

and a ‘complete victory’. This simple, urgent and direct approach he set aside when he returned to 

his official account.</p>

<p>Although the Waterloo dispatch is a narrative punctuated with those vital ‘mentions’ of 

distinguished conduct, it is not without artifice. Wellington had found during the Peninsular War that 

any hint of weakness, indecision or error was likely to be exploited by what were called ‘croakers’ 

in London – those in politics and the press eager to criticise the government and its conduct of the 

war. So he had learned to take precautions – to the point where, on one occasion in Spain when a 

subordinate drafted a dispatch he considered too circumspect, he declared: ‘This won’t do. Write 

me down a victory.’14 After Waterloo he could have had few worries about the croakers, but his 

dispatch none the less shows signs of presentational care. He avoids any suggestion that 

Napoleon’s advance into Belgium on 15 June might have taken him by surprise, or that Quatre 

Bras was, in the circumstances, a fortunate escape. And he is so discreet about the undoubted 

Prussian defeat the same day that the reader is left to deduce what happened from their 

subsequent retreat.</p>

<p>The overriding characteristic of the dispatch, however, is its restraint, and not for nothing did the 

American ambassador in London later remark that it read more like a defeat than a victory.15 The 

build-up is slow – the whole document runs to about 2,350 words and 1,000 of those have passed 

before the fighting at Waterloo even begins. Nowhere does the word ‘victory’ appear, even though 

Wellington had used it in his note to Lady Frances, nor ‘triumph’, and the only mention of ‘glory’ 

relates to the conduct of an individual officer. Sunday’s action itself flies by in just 400 words. 

Wellington wrote that the battle began with ‘a furious attack’ on his right wing, followed by ‘a very 

heavy cannonade’ and ‘repeated attacks of cavalry and infantry’ all along the line. Then in just ten 

words he wrapped up a sustained frenzy of military activity – those hours of pounding – to which 

thousands of pages of historical analysis have since been devoted: ‘These attacks were repeated 

till about seven in the evening.’ The account of the decisive period, the ‘crisis’, as it would be 

known, is scarcely less economical: ‘the enemy made a desperate effort with cavalry and infantry 

supported by the fire of artillery to force our left centre near the farm of La Haye Sainte, which 

after a severe contest was defeated’. With this, and noting that the Prussians were now on the 

battlefield in force,</p>

<span>I determined to attack the enemy and immediately advanced the whole line of infantry 

supported by the cavalry and artillery. The attack succeeded in every point. The enemy was 

forced from his positions on the heights and fled in the utmost confusion, leaving behind him 

as far as I could judge 150 pieces of cannon with their ammunition, which fell into our hands.</span>

<span>If all of this is bare of emotion, the same cannot be said for what follows a few lines later:</span>

<span>Your lordship [the War Secretary] will observe that such a desperate action could not be fought 

and such advantages could not be gained without great loss, and I am sorry to add that ours 

has been immense.</span>

<p>Not for the first time in his career, Wellington freely showed his grief and shock, and though he 

went on to name twenty- one British generals and nine colonels who had distinguished themselves 

in battle, and to praise various divisions, brigades, corps and regiments, his compliments were 

mingled with tributes to the dead and wounded in a way that might have been calculated to sink 

the reader’s heart. The final paragraph was this:</p>

<span>Since writing the above, I have received a report that Major General Sir Wm. Ponsonby is 

killed, and in announcing this intelligence to your Lordship, I have to add the expression of my 

grief for the fate of an officer who had already rendered very brilliant and important services 

and was an ornament to his profession.</span>

<p>There followed a preliminary count of the British casualties, with totals of 2,432 killed, 9,528

wounded and 1,875 missing. As Wellington knew, these would prove to be underestimates.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable document. Three-fifths of it have passed before the reader learns that the 

French are beaten, and what remains after that is largely anguished solemnity. In a short time this 

dispatch would reach an astonishingly wide readership and would attract great praise for its 

modesty but also criticism for failing to spread its compliments more widely. To that charge the 

duke would plead guilty, though he must have known that he could never have satisfied everyone. 

It is worth remembering, however, that it is a lengthy piece of work, written in the teeth of many 

distractions, in a single morning, in a state of some distress and after a night of very little sleep. 

Perfection could hardly be expected.</p>

<p>The writing was complete around noon, and Wellington then gave the manuscript to his staff to

make at least one corrected fair copy, and probably two. One of these, we know, was destined for 

the War Secretary, Lord Bathurst, but in the duke’s correspondence of that day there is also a 

short note to the Duke of York, who was commander- in-chief of the British army, saying: ‘I have 

the honour to enclose to your Royal Highness the copy of my dispatch of this date to the 

Secretary of State, reporting the military operations to this day.’16 It seems likely that this second 

copy was sent at the same time. Wellington also wrote short personal notes of sympathy to 

Alexander Gordon’s brother and to the brother of his military secretary, Lord FitzRoy Somerset, 

who had lost an arm. When all was in order these papers were placed in the hands of 

Wellington’s chosen messenger, Major the Hon. Henry Percy. The time was now 1 p.m. on 

Monday or a little later. Some sixteen hours after the outcome of the battle of Waterloo had been 

known beyond doubt, the news, in the form of the dispatch, was at last on its way to London.</p>
